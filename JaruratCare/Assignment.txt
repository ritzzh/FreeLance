Thank you for your interest in our internship opening. As a next step, we are expecting you to complete a short assignment.
Your task is to build a web application using a technology of your choice. The
app should have the following features:

1. It should have two buttons. Clicking on first button should subtract 1, and
   second button should add 1 to the given number (the application state
   variable).
2. The number you use for mathematical operations, should not exceed 150 at any
   case. The lowest possible value can be 0. (num >= 0 && num <= 150).
3. Create a Progress Bar based on the number such that if I add or subtract
   from the number, it should reflect on the progress bar (progress bar should
   update accordingly).
4. Add transition/animation to the progress bar.
5. Implement Undo/Redo for the mathematical operations.

Please upload your code to GitHub (or any other source code hosting platform).
You will also have to deploy the codebase (some suggestions: Vercel, Netlify,
GitHub Pages etc).

Once you are done, Please share URLs of the codebase and deployed website.
